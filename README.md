# A Look at terrorism globaly and accross the US

## Introduction

We ought to analyze global trends on terrorism and answer questions such as which countries suffer most from terrorism? Has terrorism activities increased globally? How many victims terrorist activities claim each year? Then we will try to predict terrorist activities using machine learning techniques. We will visualize terrorist activities globally and in the US, analyze global and local terrorist activities data, and predict terrorist activities in the US. Our data is obtained from The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and includes terrorism data from 1970 to 2018. The main tools used are Pandas data frames, Folium for visualization, Numpy and Scipy for machine learning.
We hope this work is insightful and enable us in the future to accurately predict and prevent terrorist attacks.

## Python libraries and packages required:

folium

pandas

matplotlib

html5lib

numpy

scipy

scikit-learn
